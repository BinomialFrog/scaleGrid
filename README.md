## Grid Scaler

To use the the tool, use the button available in the Actor List (for GMs only) or in the Actor Sheet header (for all players). Instructions are provided in the prompt.

## Compatibility

Requires FVTT version 0.1.0 or higher

To install a module, follow these instructions:

1. [Download the zip file]
2. Extract the included folder to `public/modules` in your Foundry Virtual Tabletop installation folder.
3. Restart Foundry Virtual Tabletop. 

## How to Use the plugin

Once the plugin is loaded a new icon will appear on the main tool selection called (Get Grid)

Make sure your maps current X/Y offset is set to 0 or this will not work right. (will check for this in the future and modify accordingly)

Click on this then select two points on your map (preferably two corners of a square).

This will then adjust the Grid Size along with the X/Y offset to try and match whats on your map.

It may not be perfect but I will be close. 

### Features in planning (maybe?)

1. Instead of clicking on two point, actually draw a square on the canvas then use that as reference points. Would make it easier for maps with no pre-existing grid lines.
2. Create a new Menu button which will put this tool and the following idea in their own space.
3. Create an X/Y adjustment button which will take a reference click and move the grid to the click in the requested axis.

## Notes and Mentions

This is my first foray into working with Javascript/HTML/jQuery/CSS. So its rough but I hope to polish it up. Any suggestions on code/cleanup/what can be done better just message me on discord!

### Big thanks to Atropos, Felix ( aka sly3r86 ) for their help and the code which was totally not butchered to make this.
